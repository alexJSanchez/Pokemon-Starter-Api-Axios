//   explanation: "For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective.

I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didnâ€™t feel like a giant. I felt very, very small."
